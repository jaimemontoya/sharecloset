**What is the proposed name for your Web application?**  
Sharitable  
  
**Who is the target audience for your Web application?**  
* Local community service organizations: the place that needs the donation.  
* Individual donors: the people giving the donation.  
  
**What problem is it intended to solve for that audience?**  
* Individuals don't always know which organizations have a use for or are accepting the items they wish to donate.  
* Smaller or newer organizations don't always have a large platform to disclose their needs. For larger organizations, it helps reduce getting donations that cannot be put to use.  
* All organizations, large and small, can be found in one convenient application.  
  
**How will it meet the minimum project requirements?**  
**CREATE:** Allow donors to create an account that keeps track of their donations. Allow organizations to create accounts and list their needed items and contact information.  
**READ:** The individuals will be able to find organizations by filtering the database on the items they wish to donate.  
**UPDATE:** Individuals will update their profile information and the items they wish to donate. Organizations will update information like the items they need and their contact information.  
**DELETE:** Individuals and organizations can delete their accounts as well as donation items they have or need, respectively.  
  
**What is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?** 
The application is unique because it addresses an issue that is prevalent across many local communities and presents a technological solution. By creating a centralized place where donors and organizations can connect, it makes the process of donating items much easier. This website is also unique because it does not focus on monetary donations. It focuses on donating items that can be immediately put to use, such as clothing, tables, beds, etc. It is also very donor centered in that it is up to the individual to reach out to the organization. It will go beyond the minimum requirements because it will use Google Maps API to find local organizations. In addition, the website will solve a real problem, providing an interactive platform to connect individuals with organizations that goes beyond the requirements to create, select, update, and delete entries from the database.
