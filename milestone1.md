**Who is the target audience for your Web application?**
The target audience are local community service organizations and individuals who wish to donate items. We are particularly considering organizations that take donations year-round, but may not have ways to find donors who have exactly the items that the organization needs. Our target audience also includes individuals who want to feel confident that their donations reach the people who need them most.

**What problem is it intended to solve for that audience?**
The problem that this application is intended to solve is connecting donors with organizations that really need their donations. It also allows smaller organizations to get their needs out to the public instead of relying entirely on word of mouth. Individuals can find exactly where their donations are needed  and organizations can advertise their needs for donations, all in one application.

**How will it meet the minimum project requirements?**

**CREATE:** The application will allow donors to create accounts and keep track of their donations. Organizations will also be able to create accounts and list their needed items and contact information in case individuals want to donate to their wishlist. Users will insert items into the database and organizations will create a wishlist of items that they need in order of priority..

**READ:** Users will be able to select and filter the organizations where they want to donate items through the website. Selecting items from the wishlists created by the organizations will facilitate the connections between donors and organizations.

**UPDATE:** Users will have the option to update the items that they have available to donate. Organizations will update their wishlists to reveal the needs they have for new donations. Both uses and donors will have the option to update their contact information.

**DELETE:** Individuals can change their mind and remove items that they had offered to donate. Similarly, organizations can remove items from their wishlists, for example, if they receive enough donations of the same item or if they simply do not need that anymore.

**Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?**
This application is unique because it addresses an issue that is prevalent across many local communities and presents a technological solution. By creating a centralized place where donors and organizations can connect, it makes the process of donating items much easier. This application is also unique because it does not focus on money donations. It focuses on donating items that can be immediately put to use, such as clothing, tables, bed, etc.
